"""Spatial operations for impact assessments.

This package provides spatial operations including:
- Assignment operations (majority overlap, nearest, intersection, etc.)
- Overlay operations (buffer, difference with precision control)
- Common operations (clip, spatial join with precision, geometry validation)
- General utilities (CRS handling, precision models)

Commonly used exports:
- execute_assignment: Main entry point for spatial assignments
- majority_overlap: Assign based on largest overlapping area
- any_intersection: Assign all intersecting features
- nearest: Assign nearest feature
- intersection: Full spatial overlay
- buffer_with_dissolve: Buffer with optional dissolve
- spatial_join_intersect: Spatial intersection with precision control (replaces PairwiseIntersect)
- spatial_difference_with_precision: Difference (erase) with precision control
- clip_gdf: Clip GeoDataFrame to extent
- make_valid_geometries: Repair invalid geometries
- ensure_crs: CRS validation and transformation
- apply_precision: Apply precision model to geometries
